# Functions in C 

## Questions 
 1. Write a C program that defines a function to find the maximum of two numbers. The program should take two numbers as input from the user and use the function to display the maximum of the two.

 2. Create a C program with a function to check whether a given number is prime or not. Take the input from the user and display an appropriate message.

 3. Design a C program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a function. Take the input from the user and display the result.

 4. Design a C program with a function to calculate the sum of digits of a given number. Take the input from the user and display the result.

 5. Write a C program that defines a function calculatePower to calculate the power of a number. The program should take two inputs from the user: the base and the exponent. The calculatePower function should then compute and return the result of raising the base to the power of the exponent. Finally, the program should display the result.

 Example: 
 ```
 Enter the base: 2
Enter the exponent: 3
2^3 = 8
 ```
