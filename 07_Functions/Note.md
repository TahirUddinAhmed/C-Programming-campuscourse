# Functions
A function in C is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions are designed to be reusable, modular components that can be called from various parts of a program. They help in organizing code, making it more readable, maintainable, and efficient. Functions typically take input parameters, perform some operations, and may return a value.

There are two types of function in C - 
1. Built in Function
2. User defined function
